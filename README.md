# Getting help

The easiest way to get help about how to use this library is to post your question on the
[Respect discussion group](FIXME). I will be glade to answer. I may have already answered the
same question so before, you post your question take a bit of time to search the group.

You can also read these documents for further documentation:

# Reporting bugs

Even if I prefer patches, I also like bug reports. Feel free to create new issues in this project bug tracker on
GitHub. I will tag them. Before you start just a few reminders:

1. A bug that I can reproduce on my machine is a half-fixed bug. So please, include as much information as you can.
   The best would be to include a failing test or a small ruby script reproducing the bug. If you can't be sure to
   mention the version of Ruby you have used, th full backtrace of the exception if you add one, etc...
1. A documented and tested feature is a half-implemented features. Sometimes English and natural languages in general
   failed to describe your thought precisely. A failing test will mean exactly what you want.
1. Do not post question in the issue trackers. Use the [Respect discussion group](FIXME) instead.

# Contributing patches

I spent quite a lot of time writing this gem but there is still a lot of work to do. Whether it is a bug-fix,
a new feature, some code re-factoring, or documentation clarification, I will be glade to merge your pull request
on GitHub. Before you start a few reminders:

1. Every commits must have a comprehensive commit message.
1. Whenever you are fixing a bug or adding a new features, tests are required.
1. A bit of documentation so that others can understand your code.
